# Changelog

## 0.7.0 — 2026-10-21
First public release of GeoCrop Engine (formerly the internal "Open GeoCrop Engine" prototype, package `etfarm_ml`).

### Added
- Package renamed to `geocrop`; single `geocrop` CLI; YAML configuration with strict validation and fingerprints.
- Resumable config-driven pipeline (`geocrop run`) with stage cache and run manifests.
- Reference grid builder; scene metadata (`scene.json`) and window assignment/inventory.
- Sentinel-2: metadata-driven SAFE import incl. cloud probability; SCL + probability masking with halo-safe
  dilation; same-day tile mosaicking; median/mean/percentile composites; `valid_count`.
- Sentinel-1: SNAP graphs for σ⁰ and terrain-flattened γ⁰ (corrected step order, Copernicus DEM, projected output);
  scene import; linear-domain composites, optionally per orbit direction.
- Index registry (15 optical/radar indices with formulas and references); feature stack with deltas, seasonal
  statistics and feature manifest; feature selection by group/window.
- Windowed sample extraction; class-stratified spatial-block CV; grid tuning; bootstrap CIs; calibration (ECE);
  uncertainty raster (max probability, margin, entropy).
- Ablation experiments with McNemar tests; recursive feature reduction; group importance.
- Parcel aggregation with interior buffer, three decision strategies, declaration status, second-stage parcel model.
- Independent validation with season filter, leakage exclusion, window vote, reject curve; Olofsson area estimation.
- CDSE inventory with product attributes and size forecast; token refresh; resumable download with checksums.
- OBIA tiling by object density; U-Net with BCE+Dice, normalisation contract and overlapping inference;
  object-level segmentation metrics.
- Neutral parcel adapter with pseudonymisation; GIS-inspectable fold assignment; input quality checks.
- Documentation set, CITATION.cff, CI on Python 3.10–3.12.
